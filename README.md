# Website Design - Portfolio Concept

Website design to display your design portfolio. Website holds the necessary pages to tell a story about yourself; about, projects, resume and a contact page. Simple and minimal design, that is easy to read and visually appealing to look at. The website design focuses as you as a person, displaying your top projects and latest skills and experiences.

## About

This project was made for CCT360, University of Toronto. This was a final project that was aimed to create a portfolio website for yourself. I decided to keep my layout simple and go for a minimal design, so content is not cluttered. I designed this website with a CSS framework [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), and a nice dark mode theme. The focus of this project is creating a website design that is responsive, and appealing to look at. I went with a modern approach to typography and card design, to make the overall website look a little more sleek and clean. Alongside the website design, we also did a small write up on the design process, explaining our thought process on our design choices and planning.

## Final Remarks

The entire project was a good learning foundation to proper responsive design. The project goal was to ensure that we were able to make the website look desirable at different display sizes. In which is an important fundmental in web development. I definitely made sure to organize both CSS and HTMl documents thoroughly, expecting that anyone who wants to use this as a template can substitute without a problem. I aim to use the design process and principles I learned from this project on any future website developments in the near future.
